**FasterScroll v0.0.2**

Increase SongList scrolling's speed to your own taste, change its acceleration curve, its max speed (only affect joystick input). Tweak its rumbling effect too if you want. It should be fully compatible with nalulululuna's RumbleMod settings so don't worry about overriding stuff here. No more worries, no time for this you gotta go fast, no more time wasted scrolling for song at snail pace.

Features : 
- 4 speed curves (Constant, Linear, Exponential, Stock/Default) with their own customizable settings 
- 3 rumble modes (Override, None, Stock) to fine tune those vibs
- RumbleMod's compatibility
- An overextended description
- (probably some bugs, it's an early version, if you find some contact me)
