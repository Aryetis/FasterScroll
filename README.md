# FasterScroll

## Description :

Increases SongList scrolling speed to your own taste, change its acceleration curve, its max speed
Tweak SongList scrolling rumbles too (your wrists will thank you for this).
If a picture is worth a thousand words... How much is it for a gif ? Here's a quick demo of this mod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsHk499Rog">(Full demo YT link)</a> :

## Why ? 

Because if you're like me, you probably have over 9000 problems also known as maps. Therefore you know how much of a drag it can be to look for a song you don't know the exact title, look for a song that you added a couple weeks ago, scroll along your seemingly infinite "favorite" playlist etc...

"But why don't you use the scroll bar handle ?" : Because it's gone! It's too small to grab! I don't waste my time fixing non existing problem.
